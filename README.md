## Overview
This portfolio website is designed to provide an organized presentation of my personal programming projects, including game development and engine development. Additionally, it includes sections about my personal interests such as music, movies, and books that inspire me.

The site is divided into different sections, each highlighting a specific category of projects or personal interests.

## Sections

### Programming Projects
Here, you will find a collection of my game development projects, using different engines and technologies.
